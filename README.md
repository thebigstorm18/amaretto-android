# MUTEQUI

This is the Android Application for the first called *amaretto* Project, later know as *Mutequi*. Mutequi has been developed at the social hackaton *HackForGood Madrid 2013* in a 36h non-stop rush (pretty crazy, but a lot of fun).

## What is Mutequi 

Imagine a plataform that allows you to exchange abilities, services and products with the people of your community. With a intern currency and a strong gamification, mutequi could be a breath of air in this times of crisis. 

## Current state

At the moment, we don't have plans to continue with the development of Mutequi. If you're interested in working with the sources of the Android application, [contact me (Toni Prada)](mailto:toniprada@gmail.com). You can contact me to ask about the amaretto project (api, web frontend, app) too, and I will you put in contact with the whole team.
